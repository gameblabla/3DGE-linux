3DGE-Linux

3DGE-linux is a fork based on 3DGE that aims to fix the various errors and warnings
the official 3DGE repo is suffering from.
This allows you to build a Linux version too, unlike the official version.

To compile it :
make -f Makefile.linux

You can build it with scons too:
scons

All the files required to run 3DGE can be found in the folder "Release".
For doom, you need to buy it in stores like Steam.
Don't buy the copy provided with Doom 3 BFG edition, that copy is missing some important files.

If you don't have Doom, you can also use it to play Freedoom or Hacx.
